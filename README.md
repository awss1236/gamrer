# Gamrer
This is a utility that allows for transforming Backus Naur form
grammars into directly usable parsers in haskell.

## Usage
Right now I don't ship an executable so you'll have to compile it,
which is not difficult as the program doesn't have any dependencies
outside of the standard libraries yet. (Consult `build.sh`)

After you've built it you can use it directly by giving it the path
of a file containing the grammar:
```
./main FILE
```
The Program outputs to stdout though so you may want to do a little
bit of shell magic:
```
./main FILE > OUT.hs
```
Where `OUT.hs` would then contain the output code.

## Using the generated code
Making the generated code more usable is a big TODO for now.
But you can still copy paste the genertated code into an app
although I really wouldn't reccomned it (It's really ugly
right now).
You may also wrap it into a module.
